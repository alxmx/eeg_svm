User Experience (UX) Questionnaire Evaluation - Placeholder

This script is intended to automate summary statistics from user questionnaire responses
(e.g., NASA-TLX, SUS, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) for UX evaluation in the Mindfulness Index pipeline.

---
Expected CSV format for user questionnaire responses:
- Place files in the 'logs/' folder.
- Example filename: logs/user_experience_{user_id}_{session_time}.csv
- Columns: [user_id, session_time, question_id, question_text, response_value, response_text]
- Example row:
  user123,20250530_153000,Q1,"How relaxed did you feel?",4,"Somewhat relaxed"

---
In the future, this script will:
- Load all relevant CSVs from the logs/ folder
- Compute summary statistics (mean, std, distribution) for each question
- Output a summary report (CSV/Markdown/PDF)
- Optionally, visualize response distributions

For now, this is a placeholder for UX questionnaire analysis.
