# Dual Calibration Mindfulness Index Pipeline - User Guide

## Overview

This pipeline implements a **dual-phase calibration system** that creates personalized mindfulness index (MI) thresholds for each user. Unlike the stable version that uses population-based thresholds, this system adapts to your individual physiological patterns through two distinct calibration phases.

## Key Features

### üéØ Dual Calibration System
- **RELAXED Phase (20 seconds)**: Establishes your natural low mindfulness baseline
- **FOCUSED Phase (30 seconds)**: Establishes your peak attention baseline
- **Adaptive Mapping**: Creates personalized MI thresholds based on your unique patterns

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Data Processing
- **Peak Suppression**: Median filtering to reduce signal artifacts
- **Outlier Rejection**: Automatic detection and removal of data anomalies
- **Artifact Detection**: Real-time identification of corrupted signals
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Median-based smoothing for stable MI output

### üìä Personalized MI Calculation
- **User-Specific Thresholds**: MI range mapped to your calibrated baselines
- **Dynamic Range Optimization**: Maximizes sensitivity within your personal range
- **Session Consistency**: Uses saved calibration data across sessions

## Scientific Rationale

### Why Dual Calibration?

1. **Individual Differences**: People have vastly different baseline EEG/EDA patterns
2. **State-Dependent Calibration**: Captures both relaxed and focused states for full range mapping
3. **Improved Sensitivity**: Adaptive thresholds provide better discrimination than population norms
4. **Ecological Validity**: Calibration states mirror real meditation practice (relaxation ‚Üí focused attention)

### Calibration States

**RELAXED State (Low Mindfulness Baseline)**:
- Eyes closed, natural mind-wandering
- Represents your default, non-meditative state
- Captures individual EEG alpha patterns and EDA levels

**FOCUSED State (High Mindfulness Baseline)**:
- Eyes open, sustained attention to breathing
- Represents your peak attentional engagement
- Captures individual concentration-related neural signatures

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd c:\Users\lenin\Documents\GitHub\eeg_svm

# Run the dual calibration pipeline
python realtime_mi_lsl_dual_calibration.py
```

### 2. User Identification

When prompted, enter a unique user ID. This will be used to:
- Save your personal calibration data
- Load existing calibration in future sessions
- Generate personalized reports

### 3. Calibration Process

#### Phase 1: RELAXED Baseline (20 seconds)

**Preparation**:
- Sit comfortably in your chair
- Ensure a quiet environment
- Have your EEG/EDA equipment properly connected

**Instructions During Calibration**:
- ‚úÖ Close your eyes gently
- ‚úÖ Take slow, deep breaths
- ‚úÖ Let your mind wander naturally
- ‚úÖ Don't try to focus on anything specific
- ‚úÖ Relax your muscles, especially face and shoulders
- ‚ùå Don't try to meditate or concentrate
- ‚ùå Don't engage in mental tasks

**Goal**: Capture your natural, relaxed baseline state

#### Phase 2: FOCUSED Baseline (30 seconds)

**Preparation**:
- Keep the same comfortable position
- Have a fixed point to look at (wall, object)

**Instructions During Calibration**:
- ‚úÖ Open your eyes and look at a fixed point
- ‚úÖ Focus your attention on your breathing
- ‚úÖ Count your breaths: 1 (inhale), 2 (exhale), etc.
- ‚úÖ When you reach 10, start over at 1
- ‚úÖ If your mind wanders, gently return to counting
- ‚úÖ Maintain alert but relaxed attention
- ‚ùå Don't force concentration
- ‚ùå Don't get frustrated if you lose count

**Goal**: Capture your peak focused attention state

### 4. Real-Time MI Processing

After calibration, the system will:
- Calculate personalized MI values using your adaptive thresholds
- Apply robust peak suppression and artifact rejection
- Output smooth, consistent MI values via LSL streams
- Display real-time progress and statistics

### 5. Session Reports

At the end of each session, you'll receive:
- **CSV Data File**: Complete session data with timestamps
- **Visualization Plots**: Comparison of adaptive vs. universal MI
- **Statistics Summary**: Mean, standard deviation, and dynamic range
- **Calibration Persistence**: Your thresholds are saved for future sessions

## Output Streams

The pipeline creates three LSL output streams:

1. **mindfulness_index**: Personalized adaptive MI (0-1 range)
2. **raw_mindfulness_index**: Raw MI (-5 to +5 range)
3. **emotional_mindfulness_index**: EMI variant

## File Structure

### User Configuration Files
- `user_configs/{user_id}_dual_calibration.json`: Your personal thresholds
- `user_configs/{user_id}_dual_baseline.csv`: Raw calibration feature data

### Session Data
- `logs/{user_id}_dual_calibration_session_{timestamp}.csv`: Complete session data
- `visualizations/{user_id}_dual_calibration_mi_{timestamp}.png`: Session plots

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Calibration Failed - No Valid Features**
- **Cause**: Poor signal quality during calibration
- **Solution**: 
  - Check electrode connections
  - Ensure proper skin contact
  - Minimize movement during calibration
  - Retry calibration process

**2. Low Dynamic Range Warning**
- **Cause**: Similar features between relaxed and focused states
- **Solution**:
  - Follow calibration instructions more carefully
  - Ensure genuine state differences (relaxed vs. focused)
  - Consider recalibrating with clearer mental states

**3. Inconsistent MI Values**
- **Cause**: Signal artifacts or poor calibration
- **Solution**:
  - Check for loose electrodes
  - Recalibrate if necessary
  - Ensure stable recording environment

### Best Practices

1. **Calibration Environment**:
   - Quiet, distraction-free room
   - Consistent lighting
   - Comfortable seating
   - Stable electrode placement

2. **Mental State Preparation**:
   - Practice relaxation techniques before RELAXED phase
   - Understand breathing-counting task before FOCUSED phase
   - Take breaks between phases if needed

3. **Signal Quality**:
   - Check electrode impedances before starting
   - Ensure proper skin preparation
   - Minimize head movement during calibration

## Technical Details

### Feature Extraction
The system extracts five key features:
- **theta_fz**: Frontal theta power (4-8 Hz)
- **alpha_po**: Posterior alpha power (8-13 Hz)
- **faa**: Frontal alpha asymmetry
- **beta_frontal**: Frontal beta power (13-30 Hz)
- **eda_norm**: Normalized EDA activity

### Adaptive Threshold Calculation
```
adaptive_mi = (universal_mi - relaxed_baseline) / (focused_baseline - relaxed_baseline)
```

Where:
- `universal_mi`: Population-based MI calculation
- `relaxed_baseline`: Your personal relaxed state MI
- `focused_baseline`: Your personal focused state MI

### Peak Suppression Algorithm
1. **Median Filtering**: 5-point median filter on raw signals
2. **Outlier Detection**: Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method
3. **Artifact Replacement**: Outliers replaced with local median values
4. **Temporal Smoothing**: Median-based smoothing of final MI values
