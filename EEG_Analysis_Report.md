# EEG Signal Processing Pipeline: Data, Parameters, and Results

## 1. Data and Parameters Used

- **Data Source:** EEG CSV files from `data/eeg_by_emotion/<label>/*.csv` (labels: angry, calm, excited, sad)
- **Channels:** 8 EEG channels (Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, PO8)
- **Sampling Frequency:** 250 Hz
- **Filtering:**
  - Bandpass: 1â€“40 Hz (Butterworth, order 4)
  - Notch: 50 Hz (IIR notch, Q=30)
- **Epoching:** 2-second epochs, 1-second overlap
- **Feature Extraction:** For each channel and band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma):
  - Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis, Skewness (200 features per epoch)
- **Normalization:** Z-score per feature
- **Classification:** SVM (RBF kernel, C=1, gamma='scale', class_weight='balanced')
- **Validation:** Leave-One-Group-Out (LOSO) cross-validation

## 2. Filtering Statistics

| Channel | Bandpass (1-40Hz) | Notch (50Hz) | Mean (pre) | Mean (post) | Std (pre) | Std (post) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| ...     | ...               | ...          | ...        | ...         | ...       | ...        |

## 3. Feature Extraction Statistics (per channel, per band)

| Channel | Band | Mean | Variance | Std | Kurtosis | Skewness |
|---------|------|------|----------|-----|----------|----------|
| ...     | ...  | ...  | ...      | ... | ...      | ...      |

## 4. LOSO Cross-Validation Reports

| Fold | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |

## 6. Explanation Paragraph

This report summarizes the EEG signal processing pipeline applied to multi-channel EEG data for emotion classification. Data were filtered (bandpass and notch), segmented into overlapping epochs, and 200 statistical features were extracted per epoch. Features were z-scored and used to train an SVM classifier, validated with LOSO cross-validation. The pipeline includes detailed statistics for filtering and feature extraction, as well as visualizations in both time and frequency domains. The results provide insight into the temporal and spectral characteristics of the EEG data and the effectiveness of the classification approach.
