0        Low Values     0.210         0.312169   Unfocused          Unfocused
1     Normal Values     0.875         0.468791     Focused            Neutral
2       High Values     2.700         0.845535     Focused            Focused
3  Very High Values     8.050         0.999133     Focused            Focused
4    Extreme Values    22.000         1.000000     Focused            Focused

Warning: The following feature sets have different behavioral states:
             Set  MI (Raw)  MI (Normalized) State (Raw) State (Normalized)
1  Normal Values     0.875         0.468791     Focused            Neutral

=== Testing MI Normalization with Different Weight Settings ===

0         Default      3.70         0.937027               0.937027   True
1     Theta Focus      5.20         0.985226               0.985226   True
2     Alpha Focus      4.30         0.964429               0.964429   True
3  Equal Positive      5.31         0.986745               0.986745   True
4  Negative Heavy      1.95         0.721115               0.721115   True

Normalization is consistent between calculate_mi and normalize_mi_value functions.

Warning: State classification changed for some historical data points:
   timestamp  mi_raw  mi_normalized state_old state_normalized
1        1.5     0.5       0.377541   Neutral        Unfocused
2        3.0     1.0       0.500000   Focused          Neutral

This may indicate threshold adjustments are needed for backward compatibility.

=== Visualizing Normalization Function ===
Normalization function visualization saved to results\mi_normalization_detailed.png

Raw MI Value for Neutral Threshold (0.4): 0.5945
Raw MI Value for Focused Threshold (0.6): 1.4055

=== Testing Edge Cases ===
Zero (0.0): 0.2689414213699951
Very Negative (-10.0): 1.670142184809518e-05
Very Positive (100.0): 1.0
Extremely Negative (-1000.0): 0.0
Extremely Positive (1000.0): 1.0
NaN (nan): nan

This verifies that the normalization function handles extreme values appropriately.

======== All Tests Completed ========
MI normalization is working as expected and provides a consistent 0-1 range output.
The original behavioral state classification is preserved with the normalized MI values.
