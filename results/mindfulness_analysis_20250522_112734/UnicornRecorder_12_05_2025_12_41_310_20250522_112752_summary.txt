Rationale for Data and Parameters
-------------------------------
Mindfulness Index (MI) is computed as a weighted sum of neurophysiological features, followed by normalization:

    MI_raw = (w1 * Theta_Fz) + (w2 * Alpha_PO) + (w3 * FAA) - (w4 * Beta_Frontal) - (w5 * EDA_norm)
    MI = 1 / (1 + exp(-MI_raw + 1))  # Normalized to 0-1 range

- Theta_Fz (frontal theta): Higher values reflect focused attention and meditation.
- Alpha_PO (posterior alpha): Higher values reflect relaxed alertness.
- FAA (frontal alpha asymmetry): Reflects emotional valence and approach/withdrawal.
- Beta_Frontal: Higher values reflect active thinking and less mindfulness (negative weight).
- EDA_norm: Higher EDA (arousal) is negatively correlated with mindfulness (negative weight).

EDA data is normalized (z-score or min-max) and aligned to EEG windows. If EDA is missing or invalid, it is set to zero for that window.

Behavioral state thresholds:
- Focused: MI >= 0.5
- Neutral: 0.37 <= MI < 0.5
- Unfocused: MI < 0.37

These thresholds are empirically chosen to reflect meaningful distinctions in mindfulness levels.
